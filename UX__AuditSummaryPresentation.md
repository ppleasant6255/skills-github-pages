# UX — Audit Summary Presentation

## Status
**Authoritative (Cross-Cutting)**

---

## Purpose

Audit data is sensitive and may be restricted.
UX may present audit summaries without becoming an audit console.

---

## UX Rules

- Audit summaries are read-only
- Display only “recent activity” highlights, not raw audit streams
- Viewing audit summaries must respect permissions
- Export and deep audit browsing (if allowed) is separate UX

---

## Non-Goals

- Full audit UI
- Export mechanics
